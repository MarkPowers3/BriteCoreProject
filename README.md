# BriteCoreProject
A sample project to demonstrate coding proficiency

There are two html files in this project under the test directory.  One use Vue.js and the other uses Knockout.js
I loaded these files directly into a browser via file open to do the testing.

I used SqlAlchemy as the database toolkit

There are two RESTful API's.  One to retrieve all the risks and another to return a particular risk identified by its id.

There are also 2 python files in the test directory that interact with the db to add the data and test retrieval.

I built this in PyCHARM CE and ran it from there as well

<b>Test URL:</b>  
http://risktest.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/
                         
<b>RESTful Endpoints:</b><br/>
All risks: http://18.219.94.67/risks<br/>
Individual risk: http://18.219.94.67/risk/1 (this gets risk 1, can also pass 2 for second risk
