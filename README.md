# BriteCoreProject
A sample project to demonstrate coding proficiency

There are two html files in this project under the test directory.  One use Vue.js and the other uses Knockout.js
I loaded these files directly into a browser via file open to do the testing.

I used SqlAlchemy as the database toolkit

There are two RESTful API's.  One to retrieve all the risks and another to return a particular risk identified by its id.

There are also 2 python files in the test directory that interact with the db to add the data and test retrieval.

I built this in PyCHARM CE and ran it from there as well
